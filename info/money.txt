TIP_TITLE: How to Make Money in Red Dead Redemption 2

SUMMARY: Money can be earned through a variety of activities. Donating to the camp's tithing box (Chapters 2-4) improves morale. The primary methods for earning money are detailed below.

== METHODS ==

METHOD: Bounty Hunting
DETAILS: Accept bounty hunting missions from wanted posters at sheriff's offices. Rewards are paid for targets, brought in dead or alive.

METHOD: Completing Missions
DETAILS: Story and stranger missions often provide considerable amounts of money as a reward, sometimes ranging up to thousands of dollars from major heists.

METHOD: Fishing
DETAILS: You can catch various species of fish and sell them for money. Legendary fish can be mailed to Jeremy Gill for a special reward.

METHOD: Gambling
DETAILS: You can gamble in saloons and at camp. Poker is the most common game, but Blackjack and Five Finger Fillet are also available in certain locations.

METHOD: Gang Hideouts
DETAILS: Ambushing rival gang hideouts yields considerable amounts of money. You can loot fallen enemies and search the hideout for cash and valuables that can be sold to a Fence.

METHOD: Hunting
DETAILS: Hunting can provide high returns. Selling Legendary Animal pelts to a Trapper is a reliable way to make money. Getting a clean, perfect kill on large game also provides valuable pelts and meat.

METHOD: Robbery
DETAILS: Robbing people, stores, stagecoaches, and trains can be very lucrative but is risky. It will lower your honor and can lead to a bounty if you are caught.

METHOD: Challenges
DETAILS: There are nine sets of challenges available (e.g., Sharpshooter, Horseman). Completing ranks in these challenges often provides cash rewards, along with XP and special equipment.

METHOD: Looting and Gathering
DETAILS: You can earn money by looting dead bodies for cash and valuables. Items found across the map, like plants and tonics, can be sold to local stores. Illegally obtained items must be sold to a Fence.

METHOD: Buying and Selling Horses
DETAILS: This method is time-consuming but profitable with high Honor. With a high honor level, you get a 50% discount at stables. You can then bond with a horse to level 4 and sell it for up to a 90% profit. This works best with expensive horses like Arabians or Turkomans.
