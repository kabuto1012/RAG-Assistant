CATEGORY: General Information
CONTENT: Clothing in Red Dead Redemption 2 is important for dealing with weather and temperature. Every outfit is rated for Hot, Average, or Cold climates. Wearing the wrong clothes will cause your Health Core to drain faster. You can create and save custom outfits at a wardrobe and store up to five of them on your horse to change anywhere. Some unique clothing items, like special hats and masks, cannot be bought and must be found in the world.

SUBTOPIC: How Clothing Works – Weather and Temperature
CONTENT: Clothing in Red Dead Redemption 2 is crucial for dealing with the weather. Every outfit is rated for "Hot," "Average," or "Cold" temperatures. If you wear an outfit that is not suitable for the current climate (e.g., a winter coat in the heat), your Health Core will drain much faster as a penalty. You can check an outfit's temperature rating in your wardrobe or from your horse's cargo.
