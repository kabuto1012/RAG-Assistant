TIPS:
- This mission is difficult to get a gold medal on due to a long, unskippable 10-minute ride at the start of every retry.
- The first three wolves attack at close range, making it hard to avoid damage with the Sawed-off Shotgun's two-shot capacity.
- During the replay, you must have the Sawed-off Shotgun in your loadout, otherwise the mission cannot be completed.
- It is possible to kill some wolves by trampling them with your horse to save ammo and avoid taking damage.
- If you don't protect Javier and John from the wolves, a unique death scene will occur.

- Javier's line "I know if the situation were reversed... he'd look for me" foreshadows John's hunt for Javier in the first Red Dead Redemption.
- After this mission, the player can walk around the camp.
- If you don't eat provisions when your stamina core depletes, Javier will give you Kentucky Bourbon.
- The area on the mountain where the mission takes place becomes inaccessible due to an avalanche afterward.

- Using a weapon other than the bow will not fail the mission, but it will upset Charles.
- A rare glitch can cause Charles' AI to freeze if you take too long to get the bow from your horse.

- Be careful when stealing from the factory, as the guards' gunfire can cause the wagon to explode.
TRIVIA:
- This mission is optional. If you don't complete it, John will steal the wagon himself, and the mission will become unavailable.

- Agent Milton's line, "...you will die... savagely... all of you!" is remembered by Arthur in a later mission if his Honor is low.
- This mission marks the first time Jack meets Agent Ross, foreshadowing the final events of the first Red Dead Redemption game, where Jack confronts Ross by a river.
- Agent Milton also foreshadows his own death, remarking "Some of us sooner than others" when Arthur says everyone will die eventually.
- If the mission is started at night, a different cutscene plays where Arthur agrees to take Jack fishing in the morning.

- There are no failure conditions provided for this mission.
TIPS:
- To get the Bolt Action Rifle early, you must kill the first bounty hunter on the left in the valley with one shot. If he is only wounded or alerted, he will not drop it.
- To avoid getting a WANTED level after the mission, loot the bounty hunter camp and all the bodies *before* you free Sean.
TRIVIA:
- The mission title is a biblical reference and ironically foreshadows Sean's fate, as he is the last of the missing gang members to be rescued but the first of them to die.
- This is the only story mission where Arthur can enter the Tall Trees or Great Plains regions without immediately getting a "Dead or Alive" wanted level.
- The campfire where you meet Charles and Javier can be used to sleep, a unique opportunity in this region for Arthur.

- Vultures can be seen circling above Strauss at camp when Arthur returns, symbolizing his character as a scavenger.

- The patron Jeb, who you confront, later reappears in the Epilogue mission "Gainful Employment" to harass Sadie.
- After this mission, the Sheriff in Valentine may carry a Bolt Action Rifle, providing an opportunity to acquire the weapon early.

- If you have robbed the gunsmith prior to this mission, he will have unique, hostile dialogue.
- After this mission, the town of Valentine will be on lockdown, meaning law presence will be extremely high.

CHAPTER: 2
MISSION_TITLE: Blessed are the Meek?
OBJECTIVES:
1. Go to the Strawberry jail and speak to Micah through his cell window.
2.  **Primary Method:** Use the nearby steam donkey to attach a winch to the cell bars and pull them out.
3.  **Alternative Methods:** Use dynamite on the cell bars, or kill the lawmen in the office, loot the keys, and unlock the cell.
4. After freeing Micah, fight your way through the town of Strawberry.
5. Follow Micah to a nearby house where he retrieves his prized revolvers.
6. Continue the shootout and escape the town on horseback with Micah.
7. After escaping, talk with Micah, who gives you an off-hand holster.
GOLD_MEDAL_OBJECTIVES:
- While escaping, kill all mounted lawmen within 55 seconds.
- Get 15 headshots.
- Complete with at least 70% accuracy.
- Complete the mission without taking any health items.
FAILURE_CONDITIONS:
- Assaults, kills or abandons Micah.
- Allows Micah to be killed.
- Abandons Strawberry during the shootout.
- Alerts the law prematurely.
- Kills or abandons their horse.
- Dies.
TIPS:
- You don't have to speak to the Sheriff to start the mission; you can go directly to Micah's cell window.
- Instead of using the steam donkey for the jailbreak, you can use dynamite on the bars for a quicker, more explosive approach.
TRIVIA:
- The mission's title, "Blessed are the Meek," is a Bible verse (Matthew 5:5) and is ironic given Micah's violent and arrogant behavior throughout the mission.
- Before this mission is completed, if you become wanted anywhere in the state of West Elizabeth, lawmen will become shoot-on-sight, and you will lose the ability to surrender.
- Before Micah gets his own revolvers back, he uses a pair of Cattleman Revolvers, despite Arthur only giving him one.

CHAPTER: 2
MISSION_TITLE: An American Pastoral Scene
OBJECTIVES:
1. Meet Micah at his camp near Strawberry.
2. Ride with him to a ridge overlooking a road to ambush a banking coach.
3. Eliminate the coach's guards and driver.
4. Hijack the coach, with Micah driving and Arthur defending with a new Lancaster Repeater.
5. When O'Driscolls attack and block the road, survive the coach being blown up.
6. After landing in the river, win the gunfight against the O'Driscolls.
7. Meet Micah at the overturned coach and shoot the lock off the lockbox.
8. Split the money and go your separate ways.
GOLD_MEDAL_OBJECTIVES:
- Headshot each of the mounted guards protecting the wagon.
- Get 10 kills in Dead Eye.
- Complete within 6 minutes.
- Complete the mission without taking any health items.
MISSABLE_ITEMS:
- Liberty Hat
FAILURE_CONDITIONS:
- Assaults, kills, or abandons Micah.
- Allows Micah to be killed.
- Fails to stop the coach.
- Destroys the coach before its scripted destruction.
- Kills or abandons their horse.
- Dies.
TIPS:
- To meet the 6-minute time limit for the gold medal, you must skip all cutscenes (on patch 1.0) and use Dead Eye efficiently, as the mission timer does not slow down with it.
- After killing the initial guards, let the coach roll forward for a short time before hijacking it. Micah drives slowly, so minimizing his driving time is key, but don't wait too long or the coach will fall off a cliff.
TRIVIA:
- You can acquire a second Lancaster Repeater by looting one from a guard before Micah gives you one.
- If you stray too far from Micah during the shootouts, you will be killed instantly with one shot.
- If you don't shoot the lockbox on the coach, Micah will eventually get impatient and shoot it himself.
